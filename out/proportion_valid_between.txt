Analysing dataset combined 

Comparing all data (both conditions combined)
Hypothesis: Proportion of valid data (first 20, idealised) will be lower in experiment 2
    than experiment 1. A two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test will be used to test
    whether the distribution differs significantly between the two experiments
